## CIF-PyTorch

:rocket: **Attention! Please refer to https://github.com/MingLunHan/CIF-HieraDist for our latest and complete implementation of the CIF-based speech recognition modelÔºÅ**

A PyTorch implementation of Continuous Integrate-and-Fire (CIF) module for end-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR), which is originally proposed in **Cif: Continuous integrate-and-fire for end-to-end speech recognition** https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9054250.

### 1. A Feasible Configuration for CIF Module
```
encoder_embed_dim: 256 # should be the innermost dimension of inputs
produce_weight_type: "conv"
cif_threshold: 0.99
conv_cif_layer_num: 1
conv_cif_width: 3 or 5
conv_cif_output_channels_num: 256
conv_cif_dropout: 0.1
dense_cif_units_num: 256
apply_scaling: True
apply_tail_handling: True
tail_handling_firing_threshold: 0.5
add_cif_ctxt_layers: False
```

### 2. **Tips**

1. For speech recognition, we usually down-sample the input frame sequence to 1/8 of the its length at the encoder side to ensure efficient training of the CIF module. For other tasks, it should also be ensured that the length difference between input and output of the CIF is kept within reasonable range.
2. During training, when the scaled sum of the weights differs from the length of the reference transcription, you can truncate the reference and the model output to the same length.
3. The scaling strategy during training stage may cause gradient exploding, because the calculation of normalize scalar needs division operation. You could add a small value (1e-8) to the denominator to avoid this problem.
